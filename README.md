## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Ensure you have JDK 21 or later installed.
   - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

2. **Maven**:
   - Ensure Maven is installed for dependency management.
   - [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

3. **MySQL**:
   - Install MySQL and create a database named `locationfinder`.
   - [Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

4. **Node.js (Optional)**:
   - If you want to use a static file server for the frontend.
   - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/location-finder.git
   cd location-finder
   ```

2. **Configure the Database**:
   - The project uses an `.env` file to manage sensitive configuration details like database credentials. Update the `.env` file with your database details:
     ```properties
     SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/locationfinder
     SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=your-username
     SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your-password
     ```
   - Ensure the .env file is properly loaded by your environment or deployment setup.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to download all required dependencies:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   - The application will be available at `http://localhost:9090`.

5. **Set Up the Database**:
   - The application will automatically create the required tables in the `locationfinder` database.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Static Files**:
   - The frontend files are located in the `src/main/resources/static` directory.
   - However, the frontend is **not fully active** and is currently under development. You can test the backend endpoints directly using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.

2. **Contribute to the Frontend**:
   - Any updates to the frontend build and functionality are welcome! You can extend the existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files or rebuild the frontend using a modern framework like React or Angular.

3. **Serve Frontend Separately (Optional)**:
   - If you want to serve the current frontend files, use a static file server like `http-server`:
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     cd src/main/resources/static
     http-server
     ```
   - Access the frontend at the URL provided by the server.
